# EMT-Maps
Personal project. The dream is to make a Maps app EMTs can use. Other Maps services often don't show the most optimized route, especially in less-supported areas or countries. The goal is to always display the shortest path time-wise from point A to point B taking into account variables such as road quality, accessibility, etc.
